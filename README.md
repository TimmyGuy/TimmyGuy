👋 Hi, I’m @TimmyGuy  
👀 I’m interested in learning how and why codes work and building components to help other developers :D  
🌱 I’m currently learning the in's and out's from PHP, because unlike what others might say, PHP is still a usefull language in webdevelopment  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. Try to convince me, I'd love to help :)  
📫 You can't reach me currently through mail :( I'll fix that soon :)
